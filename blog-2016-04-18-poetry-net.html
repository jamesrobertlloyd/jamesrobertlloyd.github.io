												<h2>Poetry and computational creativity</h2>
											</header>
                                            <br>
											<blockquote>
												The world is dead and so, so,<br>
												The friends are long ago<br>
												And the stars are blown away.<br>
												<br>
												PoetryNet, 2015
											</blockquote>
											<h3>Introduction</h3>
											<p>
												A little while after Andrej Karpathy released [char-rnn](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) into the world, [Alex Davies](http://www.alexdavies.net/) and I explored the possibility of using it to create computer generated poetry (Alex had already scraped 10,000 poems, just in case they were ever useful). We took the char-rnn code, a fair chunk of Wikipedia and the 10,000 poems and created PoetryNet. The results were "unreasonably effective" and really quite amusing. And in an unusual turn of events, we adapted the system to provide lyrics for a [musical staged in London's west end](http://beyondthefencemusical.com/).
												<br><br>
												In this article we offer the brief thoughts of two computer scientists on creativity and probe the poetic powers of a char-rnn. But mostly this is an excuse to copy paste amusing passages of computer generated ramblings.
											</p>
											<h3>How can a computer learn to write poetry?</h3>
											<p>
												Consider the following sentence fragment
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												The cat sat on the...
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												What comes next? How about this sentence (and word) fragment
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												The cat sat on the m...
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												or
											</p>
											<blockquote>
												The cat sat on the ma...
											</blockquote>
											<p>
												There are many possible ways to extend these fragments, but some are more likely than others. A computer can learn which extensions are more likely than others by seeing lots of examples. It can learn the common patterns of language and poetry.
												<br><br>
												Computers have been able to learn patterns from data for a very long time (any statistical analysis is a form of pattern learning), but recently the machine learning community has had a lot of success with neural networks. One of the factors for their success is their computational efficiency, which allows them to process vast quantities of data and potentially discover very complicated patterns. They may [not be very efficient](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jan/28/google-ai-go-grandmaster-real-winner-deepmind) with respect to the amount of data they need to ingest to learn anything, but when data is plentiful this is not much of a problem. Fortunately for us, there are many poems in the world to learn from.
											</p>
                                            <h3>Learning in action - from gibberish to semi-grammatical nonsense</h3>
<p>
After collecting 10,000 poems, we used [char-rnn](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) to read in poems character by character and then try to predict what comes next. By getting the computer to make several predictions, one after the other, we can produce an entire poem, character by character. This is quite different to how a human learns to write poetry, but we'll discuss that later.
<br><br>
Let's see the learning process in action.

<h4>After a few seconds - character frequency and not much else</h4>
                                            <br>

<h4>After about a minute - word shape things</h4>

<h4>After about 5 minutes - pronounceable gibberish and some small words</h4>
<br>
                                            <blockquote>

<h4>After about 10 minutes - very bad spelling, but starting to look like language (and it leets!)</h4>
<br>
                                            <blockquote>

<h4>After about half an hour - new favourite word</h4>
<br>
                                            <blockquote>

                                                </blockquote>
<h4>A few hours later</h4>
<br>
                                            <blockquote>
    Are you not pleasant?<br>
    And as I am leaving you my life like the earthworms?<br>
    Who cannot remember to be a room of mine<br>
    I love behind three states, or differently, and nothing<br>
    but a lovely enviet of one arrival, a cutting switchback<br>
    and wide writing in the knoll, and in my brother's warmth,<br>
    like the white black chin that prizes and forms within the sky,<br>
    and the peach with the ancient broad washed-up beard of the sky<br>
    with sudden groans of mouths of cattle and so tighter red<br>
    in the water which has been curling in its cages and comes<br>
    when she sucks me back to the face of this door<br>
    and she presses her gaze and her left hand just as he falls<br>
    a little house from heaven and takes the sleep of the morning<br>
    and the forest is afraid of the sun is the sun of the land<br>
    and by the kitchen wall and the sun of the land.<br>
<br>
    They are<br>
    bombing in<br>
    the Earth.<br>
<br>
    The world can fall and get back to be erosion, or welcome the moment<br>
    That they are hung up and the pigs live with it.
